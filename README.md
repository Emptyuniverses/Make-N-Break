All files can be adjusted as needed, if you have the ilia9341 lcd, vl6180x tof, micropython, and pi pico then no files would need to be changed. There are other files that can be searched up for instance the VL53L0X sensor
youd look up "vl53l0x micropython" that makes it to where you wouldn't need to create your own file for any electronics used.
